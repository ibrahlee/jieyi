## Recovery vs. Relaxation

Recovery rejuvenates the nervous system and clears allostatic load, measurable via heart rate variability. Relaxation, like TV with snacks, may not recover you, while an ice bath can despite discomfort
- ## Purpose as Focus
  
  Purpose anchors attention short- and long-term, resisting shiny objects unlike extrinsic rewards (money, fame). To find it, pick a problem and make solving it your purpose
- ## Avoiding Dispersion
  
  Dispersion scatters cognition across goals, requiring constant "what to work on?" decisions. A single core focus eliminates this, boosting productive sliding into tasks
- ## Eliminate, Don't Optimize
  
  Avoid "dumb optimization" like perfecting hangovers or commutes—instead eliminate them entirely

- ## Reward Sensitivity
  
  Mastering "doing nothing" heightens dopamine sensitivity, making boring tasks rewarding and enabling tolerance for long flow blocks.youtube​
- ## Phone Discipline
  
  Phone use dumbs you down via addictive UX; prioritize "flow before phone" with 3 distraction-free hours on top work first.youtube​
- ## Routine for Fulfillment
  
  Growth requires routine for fulfillment, per Maslow's self-actualization research—without it, stagnation breeds unhappiness.youtube​
- ## Tolerate Output Dip
  
  Leverage-building (e.g., workout plans, hires) causes temporary output drops; enduring them untethers output from time input.youtube​
- ## Multiple Inputs to Output
  
  Output depends on hours, flow quality, task choice, leverage, discernment, relationships, and mental models—not just time.youtube​
- ## Leverage Trifecta
  
  Master people (hires), process (automation), and proficiency (skills/knowledge) for exponential gains.youtube​
- ## Reverse Morning Routine
  
  Start work immediately upon waking when brain waves and low cognitive load favor flow; do routines (exercise, breathwork) after a 3-hour block to re-prime.youtube​
